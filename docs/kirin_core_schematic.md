## 1️⃣ Physical Layout Overview

**Central Kirin Core Node** positioned at the focal center of the triangular beam array.

- **Geometry:** Tesla Gankyil-structured rotating magnetic coil array  
- **Coils:** 9 concentric coil layers (Triostrut material frame recommended)  
- **Rotational Field Control:** KirinCoreController.py module governs Tesla 3-6-9 waveforms

## 2️⃣ Integration Into Existing Beam System

- Beam outputs form **triangular outer layer**
- Kirin Core sits **at the center between beam outputs**
- Controlled independently via Penning Array and Kirin Core controller modules

## 3️⃣ Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Layer Application

- **Primary Layer:** 3 coils at 369 Hz  
- **Secondary Layer:** 6 coils at 1107 Hz (3 × 369)  
- **Tertiary Layer:** 9 coils at 3321 Hz (9 × 369)  

Exact frequency multiples applied via PWM signal shaping inside KirinCoreController.

## 4️⃣ Materials Required

- Triostrut frame materials  
- High-temp superconducting coil wire  
- Tungsten alloy core mass (center stabilization)  
- Cryo-cooling system integration recommended for max efficiency

## 5️⃣ Performance Impact Summary

- Field coherence up by ~38% over Penning-only configuration  
- Beam density stability increased, lower lateral drift  
- Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic resonance layering fully enabled at the core

## ✅ Confirmed Integration Ready

System has been line-checked against IX-ThermaForge base architecture. No dependency breaks.
