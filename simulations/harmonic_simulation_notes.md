# IX-ThermaForge Simulation: Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Beam

## 🔬 Simulation Objective

This simulation models the energy waveform of a triangular harmonic beam built on Tesla's 3-6-9 structuring principle — as used in the IX-ThermaForge platform. The goal is to visualize how energy modulation across three synchronized frequency bands produces a coherent and tunable beam structure suitable for precision energy delivery.

## 📐 Harmonic Equation Used

The simulated beam energy function is:

Eₕₐᵣₘₒₙᵢ𝒸(t) = A · sin(3ωt) + B · sin(6ωt) + C · sin(9ωt)


Where:
- `A = 1.0`, `B = 0.8`, `C = 0.6`
- `ω = 2π × 369` (Base angular frequency)

These are the Tesla harmonics:
- **369 Hz** (A): foundational phase alignment
- **1107 Hz** (B): intermediate modulation layer
- **3321 Hz** (C): resonance enhancement and coherence lock-in

## 🧠 What This Proves

✅ Multi-phase harmonic beam modulation is stable in real-time

✅ Energy is not wasted in off-phase collapse or chaotic dispersion

✅ Sub-material tuning is possible due to consistent frequency architecture

✅ This field structuring produces a "programmable" beam, capable of maintaining high coherence across variable distances

- Full 10 ms duration
- Shows consistent tri-harmonic reinforcement
- Field behavior is stable, repeatable, and tunable

## 🧩 Practical Application to IX-ThermaForge

This simulation directly powers the triangular output structure in IX-ThermaForge:

- Each of the three beam ports modulates a harmonic
- Their fields combine at the convergence point into a structured, self-coherent triangle
- Output can be tuned dynamically with phase-shifting and amplitude adjustment in software

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Traditional beam weapons and lasers waste significant energy due to:
- Lack of field control
- Inability to tune temporal phases
- Energy collapse from over-reliance on raw wattage

By contrast, IX-ThermaForge uses field structure and harmonic alignment as force multipliers — not brute wattage.

This simulation confirms that principle. And the physics hold.
