# IX-ThermaForge: Open-Source Advanced Thermal Energy Management System

**Status: Active Repository â€“ System Files and Documentation Upload in Progress**

IX-ThermaForge is an open-source project focused on real-world, buildable thermal energy beam and field stabilization systems designed strictly for civilian industrial, research, and educational use. The system incorporates harmonic field structuring, Tesla 3-6-9 resonance principles, and advanced energy modulation methods, prioritizing non-invasive thermal management across industrial sectors.

> **Important Notice:**  
> This repository is in an active structured publication phase. Core system concepts, verified designs, and legal licensing are complete; however, specific configuration files, material lists, and performance benchmarks are still being organized and uploaded in sequential order.  
> Until all final files are present, this repository represents a live, developing resource. No component or system described herein is to be construed as finalized or fully operational until confirmed through complete documentation.
